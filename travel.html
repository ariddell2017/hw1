      I recently visited Glacier National Park this past summer, and was able to take in the incredible beauty of St. Mary Lake (photo right).
      The mountains and lakes in this area almost look fake, they are so spectacular.
      While at Glacier National Park, I completed a 20-mile day-hike completing the Pitamakan / Dawson Loop.
      I highly recommend visiting here as the people are great, and the landscapes are one-of-a-kind.

    <h3>Seaside, Florida</h3>

    <p>
      Seaside, Florida is a small community near Destin, Florida that is located in the panhandle of Florida.
      My extended family would go here for Spring Break often while we were growing up.
      It is known for a great community feel, soft sandy beaches, and incredible weather.
      Interestingly, a few years after we started traveling to Seaside, Forida, the Truman Show movie was filmed in this town.

    <h3>Wrigley Field</h3>

    <p>
      Wrigley Field is a 101-year old baseball stadium that is home to the Chicago Cubs.
      Located on Chicago's northside, Wrigley Field is located in the Lakeview community, and is surrounded by bars, restaurants, and residential homes.
      It is truly a special place, with an iconic scoreboard, outfield ivy, and marquee at the main entrance at Clark and Addison.
      This is a great place to visit for people from out of town, or just to bring friends if you are from Chicago.
      Special times lie ahead, as the team is on the rise, and made the playoffs last year - losing to the Mets in the NLCS.
